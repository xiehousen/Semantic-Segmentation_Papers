## Datasets

The papers related to datasets used mainly in natural/color image segmentation are as follows.

- [[Cityscapes]](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cityscapes)  **Cityscapes** is a large-scale database which focuses on semantic understanding of urban street scenes. It provides semantic, instance-wise, and dense pixel annotations for 30 classes grouped into 8 categories (flat surfaces, humans, vehicles, constructions, objects, nature, sky, and void). 
- [[Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/)] **PASCAL VOC 2007** is a dataset for image recognition and image semantic segmentation.
- [[ADE20K](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/)] The **ADE20K** semantic segmentation dataset contains more than 20K scene-centric images exhaustively annotated with pixel-level objects and object parts labels. There are totally 150 semantic categories, which include stuffs like sky, road, grass, and discrete objects like person, car, bed.

## Performance tables

We show several evaluation indicators and **backbones** used in the performance table, and indicate the year and source of the article.
